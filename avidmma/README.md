# avidMMA
avidMMA is a one stop shop for hardcore MMA fans to make predictions and compare amongst friends. The goal is to obtain the users prediction pre-fight, and rank thier prediction to portray the users knowledge of the sport, though some luck does play a part. 

Users are able predict the outcome of a fight and will rank them along with their friends based on an alogrithm of who has guessed the most correct for a particular event, week, or maybe even month. 


# Login/Sign Up

The login/signup process has been made easy and secure with the help of firebase's authentication which makes the process a breeze. Not only that, but increases a measure of security which google takes care of in the back-end.

There is an additional login/sign up feature that includes twitter. Users are able to authenticate and sign up via twitter which comes with increased security that traditioal email/password can't provide off the bat.

# In App

Users will be able to predict fight outcomes only up until the day before of the event. After that, an algorithm we've written will disable the function to pick or even switch fighter choices to avoid "cheating". 

User are also able to interact with their friends and come together in a sort of community, all built around MMA and thier love for it. 

# Profile

Users have preset profile according to their credentials (google/twitter) they have chosen to login with, but also have the option to change an image or display name if they decide to.
